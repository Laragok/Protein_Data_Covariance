My project "Covariance In Proteins" is a mix of computing and biology. It models predictions by  using the "em_max", "ex_max" and "states_0_brightness" phenotypes on two different protein representations "pc_coords" and "proteins_projeted_pc_coords". The aim of the project is to determine to what capacity these phenotypes can be predicted by the R^2 predictive metric using a linear model of the above representations.
